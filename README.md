# About the project

In this project I will be using various python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to clean, explore, and analyse the data.  
At the bottom of the notebook it contains all the insights I have gathered from the analysis.
  

The data contains nearly 100,000 sales information about two brands, Yeezy and Off-White and was obtained from https://stockx.com/news/the-2019-data-contest/   
  Each sale information contains the order date, name of the brand, name of the sneaker, sale price, retail price, buyer's region and other attributes.  
  
  #### Added an Excel file which contains an interactive dashboard made from using the same data set

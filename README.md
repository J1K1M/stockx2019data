# About the project

The project is to explore and analyse the sales data from StockX 2019 Data using Python.  
It contains code, comments and questions that I made, thought process I had while looking through the data.
 

The analysis was carried out to explore the sales data from StockX and to find answers to by comparing figures from the two different brands such as: 
- Which brand sold more?
- What is the more profitable brand?
- Which brand made more sales?  








The data contains nearly 100,000 sales information about two brands, Yeezy and Off-White and was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hudsonstuck/stockx-data-contest   
  Each sale information contains the order date, name of the brand, name of the sneaker, sale price, retail price, buyer's region and other attributes.  
  
  #### UPDATE Added an Excel file which contains an interactive dashboard made from using the same data set
